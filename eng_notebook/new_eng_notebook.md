# Design Notes

As we began considering this project, we began by outlining a list of design questions, in addition to the functionality built in the spec, as guiding principles for our implementations.

The spec as-is is fairly functional. However, one key flaw (in our eyes) is that there is no verification of users. Someone can send a message to "James", a username that exists, and someone else can easily pull the messages of "James". An additional UX problem that can crop up comes from the terminal interface we use for the application: sometimes, due to latency or rapid client actions, a long server response (like listing undelivered messages) can conflict with the next terminal prompt or user input. To address that, we added buffering on the client side.

## Passwords

While the server is running, we want to keep user experiences mroe secure. To that end, we use passwords.

**The First Implementation**

We began with the following client/server implementation that performed an initial authentication of username/password:

```
- the CLIENT makes a request to the SERVER to:
    1) create an account
    2) log in to an account
- the SERVER verifies this action with information passed by the CLIENT.
- if successful, the CLIENT has a hidden field `signed_in_user` that populates with their username

From then on...
- On any actions that require verification (like message sending), the CLIENT passes `signed_in_user` to the server
- the SERVER accepts the username as proof that the CLIENT logged in, and performs the action.
- if the CLIENT wants to sign out, `signed_in_user` is cleared.
- if the CLIENT logs back in, `signed_in_user` is populated again.
```

At first glance, this seems like a reasonable way for someone to perform privileged actions without having to provide authentication (e.g. a username and password) each time. It is similar to some of the earlier solutions used to keep someone logged into a website; after log in, the website keeps a cookie in the user's session that is provided alongside any HTTP request to perform a privileged action. In our case, the "cookie" is just the username, and the usernames are all listable by any user! This means a malicious actor, if they knew the workings of the code and wire protocol, could make priviliged actions on behalf of any user. Not so good...

To protect against these attacks, we changed our implementation to give every client a secure 16-byte token randomized token that is required for privileged actions; this means random actors can't simply make server requests on others' behalf. See the next section for more details.

> It turns out that exploits of our first password implementation are similar in spirit to an early web attack. Early solutions for staying logged in throughout web sessions were unfortunately vulnerable to a key exploit: if users could be socially engineered to perform certain actions (like clicking a link somewhere), those actions could trigger a [**cross site request forgery (CRSF)**](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) attack. These attacks would then send a malicious POST request to the server using the user's credentials (basically taking advantage of the fact that the user, by logging in previously, was already in the "walled garden"). The **solution** to CRSF attacks is similar to what we did, which is that websites use [**authentication tokens**](https://crashtest-security.com/csrf-token-meaning/) for secure actions.

**The Second Implementation**

On a second go, our implemntation now looks like this:

```
- the CLIENT makes a request to the SERVER to:
    1) create an account
    2) log in to an account
- the SERVER verifies this action with information passed by the CLIENT.
- if successful, the SERVER passes an `auth_token` to the CLIENT.

From then on...
- On any actions that require verification (like message sending), the CLIENT passes an `auth_token` to the server.
- the SERVER accepts the token as proof that the CLIENT logged in, and performs the action.
- if the CLIENT wants to sign out, `auth_token` is cleared.
- if the CLIENT logs back in, `auth_token` is populated again with a new randomized bytestring.
```

This implementation is now secure against malicious requests!

# Wire Protocol Design

We begin this section by outlining some of our design principles for our own wire protocol. We had a few important goals in mind in design:
- **Clean/Space-Efficient**: Minimal wire protocol that keeps message sizes small.
- **Flexible with different messages/actions**: Something that can handle messages of any size and different client/server actions with minimal overhead.

To that end, this is what our protocol looks like:
```
(1) 1 byte version #
(2) 1 byte action #
(3) 4 bytes size of body
(4) [size] bytes body
(5) 16 bytes of authentication, if necessary
```

Every interaction between client and server will have a version #, an action #, and a size of body. The rest of the fields depend on client/server specifics.

All strings are formatted in `utf-8`, where each character is 1-4 bytes.

## Actions

There are **two core layers of actions**: 1) those that require a body, and 2) those that are privileged.

Some client > server requests have a body, like sending a message or creating an account/logging in. These will have a 4-byte integer for the size of the body, followed by the body itself (so the server knows *precisely* how much to read). Others actions don't have a body, like requesting a list of usernames. These will have a single-byte "0" for the action number (see `wire_protocol/ZERO_BYTE`).

Some client > server requests require authentication, like sending a message (which needs a message body) or deleting an account (which doesn't need a message body). After reading the body, depending on what action the client tries to take, the server will check for authentication if necessary. This will be a 16-byte secure randomized token given to the client upon creating an account or logging in.

There are two core actions the server performs: confirming the success of a client action (log in, account deletion, etc.) or 2) returning information to the client. There are methods for both.

## Action Codes

Client | Code | Action |
------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
0 | A | B |
1 | B | C |

## Separation of Concerns (Important)

An important design aspect of our naive implementation is separation of concerns between server and client. An easy pitfall to fall into with the wire protocol is to perform all application logic on the server side and overload strings when returning messages back to the client. To that end, we only transfer data when **explicitly requested**; all error handling and string parsing is done on the client side.

> **This mini

For instance, when undelivered messages are requested, they are sent back. However, if a client tries to log in with an incorrect password, the server only returns an error token and error message handling is done on the client side.

## Message Buffering

We considered two solutions to real-time message delivery:

The first was to keep a background thread pulling messages, "buffering" those messages until the next time the client is available (e.g. not typing in a command), and delivering.

Functionally, however, this just waits until the client has made some command line interaction and then drops in the messages. Instead, we pull for messages each time the client interacts with the command line and display any if they are queued. This is slightly more packet calls but substantively easier to implement.

## Unit Tests

We sought to design unit tests that would isolate and test the functionality of individual network components. In particular, our unit tests test these items:
- Signing up
- Listing accounts
- Sending and delivering messages
- Account deletion

## Error Handling

Our server spawns a new thread for each incoming connection. To handle client/server failures or timeouts, we implemented the following behavior:

> All of this is true to my knowledge only for naive (dk about GRPC)

Behavior | Client: Timeout | Client: Volunteer Exit | Client: Crash
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | -------------
Server | Watchdog closes socket connection + thread. If client side tries to connect again, exception caught. | I think the server socket just times out and then the server closes it. But there should be a message sent to just auto-close. | Unclear (I think the server will just close it after 600 seconds?)

Behavior | Server: Timeout | Server: Volunteer Exit | Server: Crash
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | -------------
Client | The client just hangs. | Not implemented. | I think this gets caught in a try/except (e.g. if the socket is broken then it's caught).

> TODO, JEFF: Add more detail here.

## Drawbacks/Improvements For The Future

> Passwords, accounts, etc. are wiped out when the server instance stops running. A more robust version of our application would store the data in some permanent memory.

# GRPC

We also used GRPC to handle the wire protocol. Below, we describe differences in GRPC vs naive from an empirical and theoretical perspective.

## Error Handling

We can generally consider GRPC as a black box.
We added two try/excepts

### Packet Sizes

For an empirical comparison of the na√Øve implementation and the GRPC implementation, we started a `tcpdump` session and completed the following simple actions in both codebases:

1. Started the server and the client.
2. Created a user named `test` with password `password`.
3. Listed users.
4. Quit the client.

Our full `tcpdump` logs can be found in [tcpdump-grpc.txt]() and [tcpdump-naive.txt](). In summary, we found the following:

 | Na√Øve | GRPC
| -------| -------- |
Maximum packet length | 22 | 289
Average non-0 packet length | 6.9 | 64.7
Non-0 packet count | 20 | 30

As shown above, our na√Øve implementation uses both fewer and smaller packets. Intuitively, this makes sense, as our wire protocol was designed to use the minimum number of bytes possible to reasonably convey the given information, while the GRPC functionality for each message likely extends beyonds the needs of this project. In other words, while GRPC allows for more flexibility and a robust protobuf-based architecture, it also adds an additional byte overhead that can be removed using lower-level socket engineering.

### Code simplicity

We found that GRPC significantly simplified the protocol definition process, as it allowed us to specify our data types as a protobuf file and receive helper types and functions for transmitting those data types over the wire. Moreover, since GRPC handles much of the connectivity, it simplified the process of connecting the client to the server. Furthermore, we sometimes dealt with small byte errors (offsets, uncaught byte sends, etc.) as our own wire protocol became more complicated to handle the task at hand; GRPC fixed those issues for us.

However, one downside of GRPC is that it requires additional dependencies both to compile the protobuf file and execute the resulting server code. Additionally, we found that GRCP had reduced flexibility when compard to the pure socket approach. For instance, when relying on sockets directly, we were able to arbitrarily deliver messages to the client at any time from the server. However, this is not possible using GRPC's standard RPC definitions, which rely on synchronous responses for each function in the service. GRPC does have a "stream" mode, but this still requires the client to initiate the RPC call, whereas sockets allow us to send messages to clients without their explicitly asking to receive them.

Lastly, the na√Øve approach allowed us to more quickly modify and debug our code, changing our wire protocol at will, whereas GRPC would require recompiling with each change to our protocol. This flexibility is both a pro and a con, as it makes dev work more agile but also more prone to breaking.
